# Day 0 – Python Installation

## What I learned
I learned how to download, install, and verify Python on my system, and how to use the terminal or command prompt to check the Python version and run basic Python commands.

## Why it matters
Installing Python correctly is the foundation of all Python development. Without a proper setup, I cannot write, run, or test any Python programs or projects.

## How it applies in the real world
In real-world software development, Python is used for building web applications, data analysis, automation, artificial intelligence, and backend systems. A proper installation allows developers to create, run, and deploy Python-powered solutions efficiently.

## Python Installation 
- Visit : https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Select version for your OS(Windows, Linux, Macos)
- Ensure you install python with administrative priviledges in windows
- Add python to system path by ensuring the PATH checkbox is ticked in the installation wizard

## Testing Installation
- Open Terminal/cmd/powershel/Bash
- Type python --version. It should return your python version eg, python 3.14.2
- Alternatively type python + enter key. 
- This will open the python Shell 
- Then write this script : "print ("Hello, Python")"
- Expected output  : Hello, Python
- This confirms python is in your system
