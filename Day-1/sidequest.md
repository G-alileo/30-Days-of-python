## Escape Sequence
- Itilizing the backslash to avoid syntax errors and add 'illegal' characters in your stings 
- EG : print ("Mike said, \"Hello James\".")

## Type Casting
- All input taken by python is assumed to be a string by python
- This has brought an emphasis on the need for the use of type casting
- EG x = int(5)
